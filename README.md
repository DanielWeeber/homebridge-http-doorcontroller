homebridge-http-doorcontroller
An HTTP based Garage Door/Light plugin for HomeBridge

About:

All Credit goes to washcroft.
Just want to make changes to this, so that I have a Door instead of a "Garage Door".
Plugin is working perfectly for me, also the update interval.

Disclaimer:
not done yet.
Wait for v2.0.0
Will update README.md accordingly
